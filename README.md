# Brain-tumor-detection-model
This Deep learning keras model is trained on mri images that contain healthy brains and brains with different types of tumors like glioma, meningioma or pituitary cancer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Objective of Project:

Researching possibilities of supporting medical staff with classification of brain tumors on mri images.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Conclusion:

Positive conclusion for the possibilitie of supporting medical staff if implemented correctly. Even though possibilitie exists the usage would be redundent due to the simple classification even by untrained individuals. (Accuracy with only 12 epochs is approximatly 95%).
